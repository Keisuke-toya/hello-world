# hello-world
just another repository

hello! I'm keisuke. First,I need to make you inform about myself.
I live in japan. I work as a engineer major of software.(honestly, I'm interested in hardware!!)
I know how to code at the java & javascript & C & C++.
I have worked for three years at Tokyo(I don't write here what the name of my company because it is biggest! everyone know! haha!!).
And I can speak english very well.
So, if you need engineers quickly, you can take a voice for me.(Ofcource in english I'm OK!!)
but it depends on your salary!(it's a joke!!)
hahahaha!
any way , please contact for me when you need engineer.
Thank you for your reading it.
